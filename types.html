                Here is a more detailed explanation of the common types of cancer that can occur in
                children:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1. Leukemia:</b> Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The two main types seen in
                children are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ALL is the most
                common childhood cancer, and it starts in the bone marrow where immature lymphocytes (a type of
                white blood cell) multiply uncontrollably. AML, although less common in children, affects myeloid
                cells, which are responsible for producing various types of blood cells.

            <p>
                <b>2. Brain and Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors:</b> Brain and CNS tumors can develop in different
                parts of the brain or spinal cord. They can be classified as benign or malignant. Some common types
                include medulloblastoma, which arises in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls
                coordination and balance; gliomas, which can occur in different areas of the brain and are named
                based on the type of brain cell they affect; and ependymomas, which arise from the cells lining the
                ventricles in the brain or the central canal of the spinal cord.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3.Neuroblastoma:</b> Neuroblastoma is a cancer that starts in immature nerve cells, called
                neuroblasts,
                most commonly found in the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. It can also develop in nerve tissue
                along the spine, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Neuroblastoma typically affects children under the age of
                5 and can vary in severity, ranging from low-risk to high-risk forms.

            <p>
                <b>4. Wilms Tumor:</b> Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a kidney cancer that primarily
                affects children. It usually occurs in children aged 3 to 4 years and is rare in older children or
                adults.
                Wilms tumor develops in the cells of the kidney and can cause a noticeable mass or swelling in the
                abdomen.

            </div>

            <p>
                <b>5. Retinoblastoma:</b> Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer that develops in the retina, the
                light-sensitive
                tissue at the back of the eye. It typically occurs in early childhood and can affect one or both eyes.
                Retinoblastoma may cause a white pupil or a squint, and it requires prompt diagnosis and treatment
                to preserve vision and prevent spread to other parts of the body.

            <p>
                <b>6. Osteosarcoma:</b> Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that primarily affects children and
                adolescents during their growth spurt years. It commonly occurs in the long bones, such as those in
                the arms or legs. Osteosarcoma can cause bone pain, swelling, and fractures. Prompt diagnosis and
                treatment are crucial for managing this aggressive cancer.

            <p>
                <b>7. Rhabdomyosarcoma:</b> Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer that arises from cells that normally develop
                into skeletal muscles. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck region,
                urinary and reproductive organs, and limbs. Rhabdomyosarcoma can cause swelling or a visible mass
                in the affected area and may be accompanied by pain or discomfort.

            <p>
                <b>8. Hodgkin Lymphoma:</b> Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, a
                part of the immune system. It is less common in children compared to adolescents and young adults.
                Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the presence of specific abnormal cells called Reed-Sternberg
                cells. It can cause swollen lymph nodes, unexplained fever, fatigue, weight loss, and itching.
