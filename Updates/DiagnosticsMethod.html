               <h1> Ways to diagnose Cancer in Children</h1>
               <p>
                    The diagnosis of cancer in children involves a combination of medical assessments,
                    tests, and procedures. Here are some common methods used for diagnosing cancer in children:
               </p>

               <p>
                    <b>1. Medical History and Physical Examination:</b> The healthcare provider will gather information
                    about
                    the child’s medical history
                    and symptoms. They will conduct a thorough physical examination to check for any signs of cancer or
                    abnormalities.
               </p>

               <p>
                    <b>2. Blood Tests:</b> Blood tests are often performed to evaluate various factors, such as complete
                    blood
                    count (CBC), blood chemistry,
                    and tumor markers. These tests can provide valuable information about the overall health of the
                    child and identify any abnormal blood cell
                    counts or tumor-related markers.
               </p>

               <p>
                    <b>3. Imaging Tests:</b> Different imaging techniques are used to visualize internal structures and
                    identify potential tumors or abnormalities. <br>
               </p>
               <p style="font-weight: bold;">Common imaging tests for cancer diagnosis in children include:</p>

               <ul>
                    <li>
                         <p><b>X-rays:</b> X-ray images can help identify tumors or bone abnormalities.</p>

                         <p><b>Ultrasound:</b> This imaging technique uses sound waves to create pictures of organs and
                              tissues.</p>

                         <p><b>• Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:</b> CT scans provide detailed cross-sectional images of the body and can
               help locate tumors
               and assess their size and spread.

               organs and tissues.
               It is especially useful for evaluating the brain and soft tissues.

                         <p><b> Biopsy:</b> A biopsy involves the removal of a small sample of tissue from the suspicious area for
               examination under a microscope.
               It is the most definitive method to diagnose cancer and determine its specific type and characteristics.
               Depending on the situation,
               a biopsy may be performed surgically or using minimally invasive techniques, such as needle biopsy or
               endoscopy.

               or abnormalities in blood cell production.

                         <p><b>6. Lumbar Puncture:</b> Also known as a spinal tap,this procedure involves the collection of cerebrospinal
               fluid from the lower back. It helps evaluate the presence
               of cancer cells or other abnormalities in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, particularly
               for cancers that can spread to the central nervous system.</p>
