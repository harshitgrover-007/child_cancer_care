                THE LITTLE CANCER STORIES
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1.ALEX SCOTT </b> Alex Scott was diagnosed with neuroblastoma at the age of one.
                Despite her own health struggles, she started lemonade stands to raise money for cancer
                research. Her lemonade stands gained attention and evolved into a movement called
                "Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation." She passed away at the age of eight, but her legacy
                continues through the foundation, which has raised millions of dollars for pediatric cancer research.

                She started the "Smashing Walnuts Foundation" to support research efforts. Gabriella

                   which resulted in her remission. Her story brought hope to many families battling pediatric cancer.
