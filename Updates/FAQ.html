        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Cancer occurs in people of all ages and can affect any part of the body. It begins with genetic change in
            single cells, that then grow
            into a mass (or tumour), that invades other parts of the body and causes harm and death if left untreated.
            Unlike cancer in adults,
            the vast majority of childhood cancers do not have a known cause. Many studies have sought to identify the
            causes of childhood cancer,
            but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors. Cancer prevention efforts
            in children should focus
            on behaviours that will prevent the child from developing preventable cancer as an adult .Some chronic
            infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr
            virus and malaria, are risk factors for childhood cancer. They are particularly relevant in LMICs. Other
            infections can increase a childâ€™s
            risk of developing cancer as an adult, so it is important to be vaccinated(against hepatitis B to help
            prevent liver cancer and against human
            papillomavirus to help prevent cervical cancer) and to other pursue othermethods such as early detection and
            treatment of chronic infections that
            can lead to cancer.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: 600;">Cancer treatments and cancer can cause side effects. Side effects are problems that

            affects healthy tissues or organs. Speak up about any problems you have. Your health care team can treat
