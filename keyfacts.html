               <h1> Key Factors about cancer in Children</h1>
               <p> <ul>
                  <li>Each year, an estimated 400 000 children and adolescents of 0-19 years old develop cancer</li>
                  <li>The most common types of childhood cancers include leukemias, brain cancers, lymphomas and solid tumours
                     such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumours.</li>
                  <li>In high-income countries, where comprehensive services are generally accessible, more than 80% of 
                     children with cancer are cured. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), less than 30% are cured.</li>
                  <li>Childhood cancer cannot generally be prevented or identified through screening.</li>
                  <li>Most childhood cancers can be cured with generic medicines and other forms of treatment, including surgery
                     and radiotherapy. Treatment of childhood cancer can be cost-effective in all income settings.</li>
                  <li>Avoidable deaths from childhood cancers in LMICs result from lack of diagnosis, misdiagnosis or delayed 
                     diagnosis, obstacles to accessing care, abandonment of treatment, death from toxicity, and relapse.</li>
                  <li>Only 29% of low-income countries report that cancer medicines are generally available to their populations
                    compared to 96% of high-income countries.</li>
                  <li>Childhood cancer data systems are needed to drive continuous improvements in the quality of care, and to
                     inform policy decisions.</li>
