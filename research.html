                  <b>1. Genomics and Precision Medicine: </b> 
                  Advances in genomic sequencing have allowed researchers to study the genetic and molecular basis 
                  of childhood cancers. By identifying specific mutations and molecular targets, scientists can develop
                   targeted therapies that address the unique characteristics of a child's cancer, leading to more
                    personalized and effective treatment approaches.

             <p>
                  <b>2. Immunotherapy:</b>
                  Immunotherapy has shown great promise in treating various types of cancer, including pediatric cancers. 
                  Researchers are exploring ways to harness the body's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.
                 This includes therapies such as CAR-T cell therapy and checkpoint inhibitors, which have demonstrated
                  impressive results in some childhood cancers.

             <p>
                  <b>3. Early Detection and Screening:</b>  Efforts are being made to improve early detection and 
                  screening methods for childhood cancers. Early diagnosis can lead to better treatment outcomes and 
                  reduce the long-term effects of cancer treatments on young patients. <br>

             <p>
                <b>Late Effects and Survivorship</b>With increasing survival rates, researchers are studying the long-term effects
                 of cancer treatments on survivors. Understanding and managing the late effects of cancer therapy, such as heart
                  and lung problems, fertility issues, and cognitive impairments, are critical for improving the quality of life 
                  for childhood cancer survivors. </p>
                      
                  
             <p>
                <b>Cancer Predisposition Syndromes:</b>Researchers are studying genetic predisposition syndromes that increase 
                the risk of developing certain childhood cancers. Identifying these genetic factors allows for early detection 
                and preventive measures in high-risk families </p>
