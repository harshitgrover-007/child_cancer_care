                <p>Dr. Audrey E. Evans was a pioneering pediatric oncologist whose work has had a profound impact on the
                    treatment of childhood cancer. Born in 1925, she attended medical school at the Woman's Medical
                    College of Pennsylvania (now part of Drexel University College of Medicine). In the 1950s, she began
                    her career at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where she encountered children
                    suffering from leukemia.
                    At that time, childhood leukemia was considered incurable, with a very low survival rate. Dr. Evans
                    was determined to change that. She teamed up with other researchers, including Dr. Werner Kalow and
                    Dr. Joseph Burchenal, to investigate new treatment approaches for leukemia. Their collaboration led
                    to the development of the first successful combination chemotherapy for childhood leukemia.

                    Combination chemotherapy involves using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action to attack
                    cancer cells more effectively. By combining drugs like methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, and
                    prednisone, they were able to induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
                    and significantly improve their chances of survival.

                    In 1972, Dr. Evans co-founded the Children's Cancer Research Foundation, which later became part of
                    the Children's Oncology Group (COG). COG is a collaborative research organization that brings
                    together pediatric oncologists and researchers from around the world to conduct clinical trials and
                    advance the field of pediatric oncology.

                    Dr. Evans's dedication and pioneering work in childhood cancer research not only improved survival
                    rates for children with leukemia but also laid the groundwork for modern pediatric oncology. She
                    passed away in 2019, leaving behind a legacy of hope and progress in the fight against childhood
                    cancer. </p>
